# AwesomeNotes
I have made a notes taking website with help of js mainly and a bit of bootstrap. Following are the funtionalties  i have added in my project.
 1) Add Note: 
    this functionalty enables t add a note which is being showed benethe the note textarea part, I have used local storage in js to make the applicatio remember the 
    previously added notes, it renders the previous notes as the website loads
  
 2) Delete Note: 
    This allows user to delete the note. i just remove that item from local storage as i get a delete request.
 
 3) Delete All:
    This feature enables user to delete all the notes on a single click, a confirmations window pops up as the user clicks it so enusre the safety of data.
    As user confirm it, the local storage of the user is cleared which deletes all the notes.
    
 4) Search Note: 
    This feature enables user to search for a note, behind the scenes the program iterates through all the notes, checks if the entered keys matches any note, if it does     not, it makes the display none for all the notes which does not have that keyword, in this way the notes being displayed are just the notes which have the entered 
    keyword.
